/*
Implement an interactive BST(Binary Search Tree)

user input -> tree = insert/ delete/ print/ end

input format command key value
command = 'a' , 'd', 'p' 'q' (add, delete, print, quit)

==> p , q => no key, value

inoder traversal (left -> data -> right)

add => if the key is already exist, printout "(key) is already in the tree"
delete => if the key is not exist, printout "<key> is not in the tree"
